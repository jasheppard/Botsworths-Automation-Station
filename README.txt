Hello! my name is Jada Sheppard.

This is a website project done in November 2023 for North Carolina A&T State University's Bi-annual 24-hour hackathon. This was a collaborative project done with 3 other members, Brianna Smith, Mackenzie Jones, and Solomon Williams. 



Our Problem Statement was to design a  solution that can demonstrate an automated manufacturing process and create an educational item for students 13-18 years of age. 

Rockwell Automation is a company that helps other industrial companies and their employees to be more productive and sustainable through smart manufacturing.
Our Main Goals were:

- Demonstrate automated manufacturing processes
- Provide an educational experience
- Create a digital product

The software/languages we used for this project was:
- VS Code Live Share for collaboration
- Scratch
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS

We decided to make a website that includes a guided lesson, Q&A, and multiple mini-games to showcase knowledge on Automated Manufacturing Systems. 

In the future, if we had more time we would have added an enhanced game library for older kids, 3D factory simulations for hands-on learning, more interactive Automated Manufacturing information videos, and possibly teach about the financial aspect of automated manufacturing.
